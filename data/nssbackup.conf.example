[dirconfig]

# In this section you describe, what directories to backup and what to skip 
# More precise commands override wider ones, for example:
# /var=1  # This means that the whole /var directory is to be backed up
# /var/cache=0 # This means the /var/cache and its sub-directories are not
#              # to  be backed up
# In this case all /var, except /var/cache will be backed up
# It works the othe way around too
# by default nothing is backed up

#	and as short as possible.
