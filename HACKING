When writing code for NSsbackup please follow the style guide for Python code,
PEP 8. See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.

Tools to ease you writing good style code are:

Eclipse IDE
Pydev
Pylint - checks the code style, imports, unused variables etc.

How to run from source code
---------------------------

Attention: For the current version, it is not recommended to install NSsbackup
for productive use and to code on it beside at the same time.

The reason is that there are 2 packages for import in
that case, it might occur name conflicts: in your development environment and
in the Python site-packages directory.

If you know what you are doing you can run development code for testing
as follows:

1. Add your development directory to the Python path. Do this in a shell, so
   it does not affect the whole system! You can use the following commands:

	declare -x PYTHONPATH="/Path-to-development/0.2/src:"$PYTHONPATH

2. Create a file `ressources` with appropriate content and place it in the
   package's top level directory. This file is used to locate certain files.
  
2. Move to the source directory to run the application you wish
	
	cd /Path-to-development/0.2/src
	python nssbackup-config-gui.py
	python nssbackup-restore-gui.py
	python nssbackupd.py
