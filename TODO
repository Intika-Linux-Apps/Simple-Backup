TODO for NSsbackup
******************

see blueprints on : https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/nssbackup/


This must be done for milestone 'Release 0.3':
----------------------------------------------

* Check how sbackupd reacts if it can not get into a folder (FUSE used by a user)
* Check filesizes (2 Gb and 4 Gb limits)
* manpage
* refactor some of the classes:
  - the Snapshot should only contain data and a SnapshotHandler (maybe the
    SnapshotManager?) should handle the handling of these data
* re-structure handling of profiles: the default profile should be a 'normal'
    profile beside the other profiles, i.e. it can be disabled etc.
    This requires some changes in the presentation of profiles to the user
    but would make the profile handling more general and consistent
* adapt log handling: there should exist a 'main' log file in the default
    directory (e.g. /var/log for super-users) where ALL messages are logged;
    this file could be self-rotating; furthermore log files for every profile
    including the default profile are created containing log messages related
    to this profile especially when making a backup;
* extend log handling: among the log files containing a lot of technical
    informations; there should be some 'end-user' log files containing all
    important informations related to a profile's backup in a readable and
    understandable way; this feature is mostly for convenience purpose
* implementation of verifying the backuped data
* realize PEP 8 style guide for all modules


Planned for later releases:
---------------------------

Features to implement:
* plugins for exporting snapshot (will be used for tape, CD ... )
* encription will be via a FusePlugin , find the fuse encripted FS
* Backup media management (via SnapshotManager )
* (Ana)Cron for non root

For UI
* show forever excluded paths in the GUI (including the backup target dir)
* no "help" on restore :)
* Follow GNOME HIG
* first time wizard
* add ability to restore more than one file/folder a time

For core
* encryption
* split master backup file into smaller pieces
* recording of a backup snapshot to a set of CDs/DVDs
* backup media management
* syslog logging
* testable system
