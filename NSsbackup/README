Simple Backup Solution

SBackup is a simple backup solution intended for desktop use. 
It can back up any subset of files and directories. Exclusions 
can be defined by regular expressions. A maximum individual file 
size limit can be defined. Backups may be saved to any local and 
remote directories that are supported by gnome-vfs.

This software is written withing Google Summer of Code 2005 for use
in Ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution.

INSTALLATION
* Please see INSTALL file.

To use.

* Go to System/Administration gnome menu and choose 'Simple Backup Config' or,
  if you prefer terminal, run 'sudo simple-backup-config' to configure your
  backup settings. Do not forget to save the configuration.
* If upgrading, backups will be updated to a new format before next backup

If you do not run a Debian derrived distribution then you can comment out
lines that backup the list of installed packages on a Debian system. 
An automatic test will be added soon, but the lack of dpkg command shouldn't
raise an exception there.

srestore.py is a command line restore tool and simple-restore-gnome is a Gnome
equivalent.

Also, please contact me, if you want to translate SBackup to your language.
