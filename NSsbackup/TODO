For 0.10:
+ Check how sbackupd reacts if it can not get into a folder (FUSE used by a user)
+ Check filesizes (2 Gb and 4 Gb limits)

For UI
* show forever excluded paths in the GUI (including the backup target dir)
* no "help" on restore :)
* Follow GNOME HIG

For core
* encryption
* split master backup file into smaller pieces
* recording of a backup snapshot to a set of CDs/DVDs
