Notes on Upgrade to 0.2.0-RC3
=============================

In RC3 the naming convention of log files was changed.

To change the names of the log files in your configuration files you
have 2 possibilities:

1. run 'sudo nssbackupconfig' afterwards you've installed NSsbackup
2. open each of your profiles in 'NSsbackup configuration tool' and
   afterwards save them again.

Please note: your configuration files are modified automatically if you
install NSsbackup from software packages (PPA) during the installation.
