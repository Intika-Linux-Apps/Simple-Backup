In RC3 the naming convention of log files was changed.

To change the names of the log files in your configuration files you
have 2 possibilities:

* run 'sudo sbackupconfig' afterwards you've installed Simple Backup

or

* open each of your profiles in 'Simple Backup configuration' and
   afterwards save them again.

Please note: your configuration files are modified automatically if you
install Simple Backup from software packages (PPA) during the installation.
