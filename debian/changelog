sbackup (0.11.5-0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

	* translations updated
	* [Fix] LP: #1000171 make it backwards compatible because upgrade-backups
						 is incredibly slow and not reliable:
						 added restore utility which provides legacy support
						 using the 0.10.5 algorithm. Command must be
						 executed from terminal: 'sbackup-legacy-restore
						 BACKUP_PATH FILE_OR_DIR_TO_RESTORE [TARGET_DIR]'
						 or for more ease of use with GTK gui:
						 'sbackup-legacy-restore --gui'.
	* remove 'backup upgrade' feature and 'rebase snapshot' feature since it
	  is not reliable and can cause severe user data loss
	* [Fix] LP: #1097465 Regular expressions defined in default configuration
						 can be improved:
						 -do not exclude specific types of files e.g. mp3, avi
						 -fix regex for .gvfs, trash, cache etc. so these apply
						  to 'top-level' directories
						 -add a default regex for lock directories
						  (e.g. $HOME/.mozilla/lock)
						 -add a default regex for $HOME/.cache directory
	* [Fix] LP: #785512 Backup files are not protect from local user access:
						make the snapshot directories RWX only by owner
						(existing snapshots are not affected by this fix).
	* Apply patch from Simon DÃ©ziel to make the temp directory
	  RWX only by owner instead of by all. (LP: #785495)
	* [Fix] LP: #330680 fails if target path contains #:
						fixed by not allowing fragments when parsing target
						path and using quote/unquote to escape # properly
						(FIXME: this fix does not cover target paths containing
						special chars ; or ?)
	* [Fix] LP: #980786 Don't complain about non-accessable excluded files:
						order of checks when inspecting file system revised. It
						is now first  checked whether a file is excluded before
						it is actually accessed.
						Thanks for Bernd Wurst for the suggestion.
	* [Fix] LP: #670646 sbackup-gtk crashes while starting: invalid literal
						for int():
						ignore ValueError from urlparse when parsing port
	* [Fix] LP: #888367 TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable:
						Try to fix type error by not using interpolation when
						getting items From ConfigParser.
	* [Fix] LP: #173490 Pre/Post backup script hooks:
						applied patch suggested by Derek Ditch
	* [Fix] LP: #918099 System menu names should include 'admin' or similar:
						applied patch suggested by Anton (feenstra)
	* [Fix] LP: #875634 sbackup's tar very slow due to erroneous backup size
						calculation:
						Sometimes the calculation of the space required goes
						badly wrong and we could end-up With _checkp=1 for
						30GB to save, making tar VERY slow.
						Fixed by setting minimum value to 100. Thanks to
						Thibault Godouet for the patch.
	* added exception handling in case of not implemented
	  'attach_to_status_icon' method (e.g. Debian Wheezy)
	* [Fix] LP: #768080 incremental snapshots store more files than needed:
	                    add TAR option '--no-check-device'. Thanks to
	                    Rogach (platon7pronko) and Felix Griewald (tiiunder)
	                    for the patch.
	* Correctly set package format to 3.0 (quilt). Thanks to Marc Deslauriers.
