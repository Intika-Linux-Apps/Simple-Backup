Source code
===========

We keep our source code in Bazaar on https://code.launchpad.net/nssbackup.
They provide a number of services to make our lives easier, listed below.

Checking out the source code
----------------------------

Get the code using bzr (an automated mirror) with::

    bzr branch lp:nssbackup


*This is the current development version*

After you've worked on your personal branch of NSsbackup, you may want to
send your changes back. For doing so use a merge directive. Email the merge
directive to the NSsbackup project who, if they choose, can use it merge your
work back into the parent branch.
