The NSsbackup API
==================

This chapter offers a more concise look at the API.

There is also a fully auto-generated API documentation using Epydoc.
See here...

Configuration files
--------------------

Log files
----------

Name of log files created by NSsbackup will always start with `nssbackup-` and
end with the postfix `.log`. 

The user is able to set the preferred directory for storing of log files but
the application decides what names exactly to use.

Some examples: nssbackup.log, nssbackup-profile a.log
