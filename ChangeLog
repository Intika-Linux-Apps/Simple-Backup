sbackup (0.11.6)

  * Add XFCE4 to list of supported desktop environments to enable status
    indicator on xfce4
  * [Fix] LP: #1174124 Catch invalid path selections to avoid TypeErrors
    when coercing to Unicode. Replace FileChooserButton with text entry
    to avoid problems when selecting destination paths.
  * [Fix] LP: #1159705 set default setting for log level as string, not as
    integer in order to fix a KeyError if no log level is defined in config
    file. Also make sure, a string is processed when setting GUI widgets
    using the log level value.
  * [Fix] LP: #1190224 Restore behaviour of GioOperations.path_exists.
    This caused a regression which let the backup fail.
  * merge fix for bug 632605. Thanks to Mascha
  * merge from trunk: add french desktop entry
  * fix internal helper tool script

sbackup (0.11.5)
  * translations updated
  * [Fix] LP: #1000171 make it backwards compatible because upgrade-backups
                       is incredibly slow and not reliable:
                       added restore utility which provides legacy support
                       using the 0.10.5 algorithm. Command must be
                       executed from terminal: 'sbackup-legacy-restore
                       BACKUP_PATH FILE_OR_DIR_TO_RESTORE [TARGET_DIR]'
                       or for more ease of use with GTK gui:
                      'sbackup-legacy-restore --gui'.
  * remove 'backup upgrade' feature and 'rebase snapshot' feature since it
    is not reliable and can cause severe user data loss
  * [Fix] LP: #1097465 Regular expressions defined in default configuration
                       can be improved:
                       -do not exclude specific types of files e.g. mp3, avi
                       -fix regex for .gvfs, trash, cache etc. so these apply
                        to 'top-level' directories
                       -add a default regex for lock directories
                        (e.g. $HOME/.mozilla/lock)
                       -add a default regex for $HOME/.cache directory
  * [Fix] LP: #785512 Backup files are not protect from local user access:
                      make the snapshot directories RWX only by owner
                      (existing snapshots are not affected by this fix).
  * Apply patch from Simon DÃ©ziel to make the temp directory
                      RWX only by owner instead of by all. (LP: #785495)
  * [Fix] LP: #330680 fails if target path contains #:
                      fixed by not allowing fragments when parsing target
                      path and using quote/unquote to escape # properly
                      (FIXME: this fix does not cover target paths containing
                      special chars ; or ?)
  * [Fix] LP: #980786 Don't complain about non-accessable excluded files:
                      order of checks when inspecting file system revised. It
                      is now first  checked whether a file is excluded before
                      it is actually accessed.
                      Thanks for Bernd Wurst for the suggestion.
  * [Fix] LP: #670646 sbackup-gtk crashes while starting: invalid literal
                      for int():
                      ignore ValueError from urlparse when parsing port
  * [Fix] LP: #888367 TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable:
                      Try to fix type error by not using interpolation when
                      getting items From ConfigParser.
  * [Fix] LP: #173490 Pre/Post backup script hooks:
                      applied patch suggested by Derek Ditch
  * [Fix] LP: #918099 System menu names should include 'admin' or similar:
                      applied patch suggested by Anton (feenstra)
  * [Fix] LP: #875634 sbackup's tar very slow due to erroneous backup size
                      calculation:
                      Sometimes the calculation of the space required goes
                      badly wrong and we could end-up With _checkp=1 for
                      30GB to save, making tar VERY slow.
                      Fixed by setting minimum value to 100. Thanks to
                      Thibault Godouet for the patch.
  * added exception handling in case of not implemented
                      'attach_to_status_icon' method (e.g. Debian Wheezy)
  * [Fix] LP: #768080 incremental snapshots store more files than needed:
                      add TAR option '--no-check-device'. Thanks to
                      Rogach (platon7pronko) and Felix Griewald (tiiunder)
                      for the patch.
  * Correctly set package format to 3.0 (quilt). Thanks to Marc Deslauriers.
