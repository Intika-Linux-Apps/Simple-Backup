                   by gconf setting)
  * [Enhancement]: package/module structure re-organized
  * [Enhancement]: code formatting and clean-up

nssbackup (0.2.1)
  * [FIX] LP Bug #588878: Backup unsuccessful due to wrong exit code handling

nssbackup (0.2.0)
  * [Fix] LP Bug #573733: nssbackup does not prevent itself from running in
          parallel.
  * [Fix] LP Bug #526544: was re-opened, missing newline at eof
  * [FIX] LP Bug #577296: Crash, with "%d format: a number is required, not str"
  * [Fix] LP Bug #258542 from Mascha's branch: adding a $ add the end of new
          file types; old file type regexps must be edited by hand to add the $;
          prior defined file types are handled as "normal" regular expression,
          display file type regular expressions also under regular expression
          tab to make this clear
  * [Fix] regression of LP #146618: The file size limitation should not be a
          recommendation
  * [Fix] regression: avoid backup of circular symlinks in the case of link
          dereferencing (follow symlinks)
  * [Fix]: implemented a work-around to enable notifications when running as
           root from cron/anacron

           stand-alone snapshots
  * [Fix]: minor changes in file collection codes (counting symlinks as
           included files)
  * [Fix]: execution of tar within empty environment; this avoids manipulation
           of tar options by leaked in environment variables and fixes a
           performance bug related to non-englisch languages (LANG) and tar
           (tar was much (6x) slower when running localized)
  * [Fix]: make uninstall and removal of debian package did not removed written
           cron entries
  * [Fix]: when starting another instance of nssbackupd or GUI tools previous
           log files were overwritten (introduces rotating log file handling)
  * [Fix]: skip excluded paths when merging snar files (see also LP #567965)
  * [Fix]: issues with non-translated strings due to incorrect import order
           of modules
  * [Fix]: typos and minor issues with translatable strings corrected
  * [Fix]: avoid system locks when running scheduled backups by decreasing
           priority of backup process (nice/ionice)
  * [Fix]: disable timeout (Signal ALARM) after exception handling
  * [Change]: Logarithmic purge disabled since it still has issues  
  * [Enhancement]: improvements to the release script
  * [Enhancement]: improved handling of tar output
  * [Enhancement]: added support for compressed log files
  * [Enhancement]: Exclude process pid files as recommendation
  * [Enhancement]: added Regex for exclusion of backup files '*~' to the default
                   recommendations
  * [Enhancement]: create a log directory exclusively for nssbackup as default
                   recommendation in order not to mess up /var/log (no changes
                   are made on existing configurations)
  * Launchpad translations merged

          in some shells)
  * [FIX] improve startup behaviour from Gnome main menu

             configuration. Menu entry is added in order to restore default
             values configuration (works with profiles) if a user wants to.
  * [Change] schedule page simplified (precise option removed)

  * [CHANGE]: 'upgrade-backups' renamed into 'nssbackup-upgrade-backups' 
  * [CHANGE]: 'nssbackupconfig' added for modification of configuration files
              during the installation
  * [CHANGE]: existing backups are no longer upgraded automatically
  * [FIX]: re-base was not working:
  		   due to errorneous merging of snapshot files
  		   and missing variable assignment -> fixed
  * [FIX]: converting an incremental snapshot to a full one was errorneous:
  		   base references of child snapshots was
  		   not updated with *.ful name -> fixed
  * [FIX] LP Bug #319294: catch execptions raised by notification daemon
  * [FIX]: logger issue (hopefully) finally solved:
  		   log messages were not printed and log files couldn't copied
  		   after backups: problem was the use of log files with equal
  		   names, the use of some static variables in ConfigManager and
  		   errors in logger implementation: now profiles use their own
  		   log files, some minor problems were fixed, code simplifications
  * [FIX]: not all messages were displayed in notification pop-ups:
  		   reason was an unescaped character: this character is now
  		   replaced, the notification code is extracted into a mix-in
  		   class to avoid multiple code definitions
  * [FIX]: pathnames to log files were incorrect and copying failed:
  		   fixed by centralized path determination
  * [FIX]: LogFactory was re-setting log level and log file when calling for
           a prior created logger: check if a logger was already created and
           don't overwrite previous settings if so
  * [FIX]: UpgradeManager used not existing FAM function:
  		   function 'rename' added
  * [FIX]: SnapshotManager tried to rebase a snapshot on itself:
  		   reason was an IndexError if only 1 snapshot was left -> check
  		   length of snapshots list
