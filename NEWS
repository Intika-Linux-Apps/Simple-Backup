  destination paths. This issue is related to GTK, for reference see:

sbackup (0.11.5), 2013-01-21

* bug fixes

* remove 'backup upgrade' feature and 'rebase snapshot' feature since it
  is not reliable and can cause severe user data loss and added restore
  utility which provides legacy support using the 0.10.5 algorithm.
  Command must be executed from terminal:
  'sbackup-legacy-restore BACKUP_PATH FILE_OR_DIR_TO_RESTORE [TARGET_DIR]'
  or for more ease of use with GTK gui:
  'sbackup-legacy-restore --gui'.

* Pre/Post backup script hooks:
  I've applied patch suggested by Derek Ditch and added this feature to
  sbackup series 0.11 (sorry for the delay...) 

  It is completely optional. To use it, please add following options to your configuration file:
  ...
  [hooks]
  pre-backup = <path to pre-backup script>
  post-backup = <path to pre-backup script>
  ...
  You only need to specify scripts that should run, just leave it out if not
  required! Please note, the script must be executable (chmod +x) and will be
  run with same privileges as your backup process. So, be careful!

* improved regular expressions defined in default configuration
     -do not exclude specific types of files e.g. mp3, avi
     -fix regex for .gvfs, trash, cache etc. so these apply
      to 'top-level' directories
     -add a default regex for lock directories
      (e.g. $HOME/.mozilla/lock)
     -add a default regex for $HOME/.cache directory
